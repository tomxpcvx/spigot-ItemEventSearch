ItemEventSearch is a minecraft plugin that allows server operators to run a small mini-game in the form of an item search. 
The plugin offers the possibility to start the event in any world on the server.
Players can search for freely configurable items in the configured world and, if all items are found, even receive rewards with the help of an economy plugin.
